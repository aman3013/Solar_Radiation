# Solar Energy Analysis Challenge
=====================================

## Collaboration
This project was completed in collaboration with the 10 Academy team.

## Done By
Amanuel Terefe

## Business Objective
MoonLight Energy Solutions aims to enhance its operational efficiency and sustainability through targeted solar investments. As an Analytics Engineer, the task is to perform a quick analysis of the environmental measurement data and translate observations into a strategy report.

## Dataset Overview
The dataset contains solar radiation measurement data, including:

* Global Horizontal Irradiance (GHI)
* Direct Normal Irradiance (DNI)
* Diffuse Horizontal Irradiance (DHI)
* Ambient Temperature (Tamb)
* Relative Humidity (RH)
* Wind Speed (WS)
* Wind Direction (WD)
* Barometric Pressure (BP)
* Cleaning events

## Project Overview
This project involves performing a quick analysis of the environmental measurement data to identify high-potential regions for solar installation. The analysis includes:

### Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
Data cleaning and preprocessing were performed to handle missing values and outliers. The dataset was cleaned based on initial analysis and missing values were handled.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA was performed to calculate summary statistics for each column, check for missing values and outliers, and perform time series analysis.

### Statistical Analysis
Statistical analysis was performed to evaluate the impact of cleaning on sensor readings, perform correlation analysis and wind analysis, and create histograms and bubble charts.

### Dashboard Development
A dashboard was developed using Streamlit to visualize data insights. The dashboard was designed to display key metrics and trends in the data, and interactive features were implemented to allow users to customize the visualizations.

### Deployment
The dashboard was deployed to Streamlit Community Cloud.
